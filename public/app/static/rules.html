      <h1>Rules of the Game</h1>

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>In Celebrity, players on two teams take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many 'Celebrities' as possible. There are three rounds (Taboo, One Word, and Charades), and the team that scores the most points over all three rounds is the winner.</p>

      <h2>Creating a New Game</h2>
      <p>Navigate to <a href="http://celebrity.kuyenda.io">http://celebrity.kuyenda.io</a> to create a new game. You'll see a four-letter short code, and a link - players can use this link to join the game, or visit the home page and enter the code. Make sure to keep this original screen open - you'll use it to start the game once enough players have joined, and will be able to see a scoreboard and other info on it as the game progresses.</p>

      <h2>Joining the Game</h2>
      <p>Once players have entered the short code to access the game, they enter their name, and then begin adding Celebrities. A celebrity may be any name, fictional or real, provided that it is someone that the rest of the group will recognize. Each player can add up to ten celebrities.</p>

      <h2>Starting the Game</h2>
      <p>Games require at least four players and twenty celebrities before they can be started. Click "Start" from the original screen you used to create the game to start it. Players will be divided into two random teams, and the game will begin.</p>

      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
      <p>In each round, players take turns trying to get their teammates to guess the names of as many celebrities as possible within 60 seconds. Each round has a slightly different set of rules. Players will click "Right" if their teammate guessed the celebrity correctly, and "Skip" if they are giving up and want to see the next Celebrity. After the turn ends, the next player from the other team will begin a new turn.</p>

      <h2>Round 1: Taboo</h2>
      <p>In the first round, players describe each celebrity using any words they'd like, with the exception of the celebrities' name, or any word that is part of the name.</p>

      <h2>Round 2: One Word</h2>
      <p>In the second round, players must use a single word to describe the celebrity - and of course, it still can't be the celebrity's name.</p>

      <h2>Round 3: Charades</h2>
      <p>In the third and final round, players may not use any words at all - only gestures!</p>

      <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
      <p>When the third round has ended, the game is over, and the team with the most points wins.</p>
